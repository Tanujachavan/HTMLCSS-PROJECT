# HTMLCSS-PROJECT
Greetings, my name is Tanuja Chavan. I am currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program, specializing in science. For my inaugural project, I have embarked on the creation of a website employing HTML and CSS.
The website is all about promoting a healthy lifestyle. 
I'm sharing interesting tips and important info about how staying healthy is super important in life. 
The aim is to help people understand the significance of good health and encourage them to make positive changes in their lives.
