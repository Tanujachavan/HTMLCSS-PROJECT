				<P class="two"><strong><u>Provides Essential Nutrients:</u></strong><br>Balanced nutrition ensures that your body receives all the essential nutrients it needs to function properly. 
				This includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water, which are necessary 
				for various bodily functions such as energy production, tissue repair, and immune system function.</P>
				<p class="two"><strong><u>Supports Growth and Development:</u></strong><br> Proper nutrition is essential for children and adolescents
				as it supports growth and development. Nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamins play a vital role in bone development, 
				muscle growth, and cognitive function during these formative years.</p>
				<p class="two"><strong><u>Maintains Healthy Weight:</u></strong><br>A balanced diet helps 
				in maintaining a healthy weight by providing the body with the right amount of calories and nutrients it needs. Consuming a variety of nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, 
				whole grains, and lean proteins, can help prevent obesity and related health issues.</p>
